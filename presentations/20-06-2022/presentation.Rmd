## What is bookdown?

Bookdown formats Rmd files in the form of pdf books (using book document type) and html books (using gitbook/bs_book).

## Bookdown is not hugo

It works without node.js dependencies.

Hooray!

## bookdown and science

Bookdown can be used to directly write scientific articles using **rticles**.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
output:
  bookdown::pdf_book:
    base_format: rticles::bioinformatics_article
```

Don't bother, you will use overleaf.

## bookdownplus

 - more outputs: ebooks and .docx (but EPUB and MOBI are already provided by the standard bookdown)
 - awesome book templates



## Bookdown is not nice

Gitbooks look okay, but the template for pdfs is extremely bare.

## Bookdown is not nice in both ways

Keeping bookdown nice for html and pdf is very time-consuming. You cannot translate css modifications to pdfs and latex templates to csses.

Still:

 - include images using knitr::include_graphics()
 - include webpages using knitr::include_url()
 - tables only using knitr::kable, xtable and flextable.
 
# bookdown helps!

## Referencing equations

Pandoc's maths support is extremely limited.

bookdown brings some new functionalities to the table:

```latex
\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:michbur)
\end{equation} 
```

And then: `\@ref(eq:michbur)`.

The equation must start with "eq:".

## Referencing theorems

```markdown
::: {.theorem #michbur name="michbur's theorem"}

For each eaten meal there is a meal that should be eaten.

:::

```
